the book reads like a storybook in paragraph form.  everything is explained in great detail from choosing yarns and hooks, to how to work a large array of crochet stitches, to how to read a pattern, right down to how to care for ones crocheted items.

the stitch drawings are clear and expertly done making learning new stitches so much easier.

the book has both a contents page and an index for easy referral.  i especially liked the fact that an index was included.  so many crochet books do not include this.  the index makes it very easy to find information on a particular topic quickly.

the recommendations for people just learning to crochet are fantastic.  this book wasn't out when i learned to crochet and i learned the hard way about many of the pit falls this book helps one to avoid.  for instance they recommend one start out with a size h-8 crochet hook and a light colored worsted weight yarn.  i learned with a b-1 hook and a fingering weight yarn.  after 2 whole days of crocheting it was 36"" long and 1.5"" tall.  i was trying to make a baby blanket for my doll (which never got made).

the book contains humor, not just in the cartoons but in the instructions as well which makes for very entertaining reading while one learns a new craft.  i always appreciate having a teacher with a sense of humor!

a good sampling of designs is included so that one can try out their skills.  these include sweaters, an afghan, doilies, hot pads, pillow, scarves, floral motifs, and bandanas.

i am a crochet designer and i read the book cover to cover like a storybook while on vacation this past week.  i thoroughly enjoyed it and learned a few things as well.  i would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the art of crochet.",Terrific Book for Learning the Art of Crochet,5,9,8,2004,2,"crocheting for dummies by karen manthey  susan brittain is a wonderfully thorough and very informative book for anyone wanting to learn to crochet and or wanting to freshen up their skills

True,2013-09-27,A25NGKNSDQY9Q5,B0007Y09VO,{'Format:': ' Kindle Edition'},"i didn't hate this book, but i have two caveats about it.  first, i don't recommend the kindle version, and second, i don't believe it's a good book for complete beginners (at least the kindle version isn't).

i knew how to crochet many years ago, had been away from it, and decided to take it up again.  so i already had the very basics down and just wanted a refresher on some things that i had forgotten (or never really learned correctly the first time).  i think this book would have provided that information very well.

however, there were several major problems.

first, the instructional diagrams were so tiny that i could barely see them.  i would guess this isn't the case in the paperback version.  this is why i don't recommend it for beginners - because you really can't see the diagrams well enough for them to help, and i think those diagrams are necessary for an absolute beginner.

second, there are a number of projects in the book, but there were no pictures of the finished projects.  i have no way to decide if i want to make it or not if i can't see the finished item. apparently in the paperback version there is a ""color section"" with photos of the projects, but this was nowhere to be found in my kindle version - which is ridiculous considering how extremely well the kindle fire would be at displaying those pictures.

i chose to return this book.  i rarely, rarely return kindle books, and i debated about it for several days.  i ultimately made that decision for one main reason.  i think it's shameful when publishers cut corners with kindle editions of books, especially when the kindle edition costs *almost as much* as the paperback edition.  it's like we're being punished for choosing to read books on a kindle:  ""you're going to pay almost as much but you don't get the same content as everyone else.""  and, again, especially when there's no reason for it - the kindle fire is extremely well suited to pictures and photographs.

i'd still like a good crochet reference, and i may consider picking up this book in it's paperback form, because i still think it has good information in it.  i just want to go somewhere where i can look at it in person before i decide to do that.

but i can't recommend the kindle version, based on my experience.

edited dec. 2013 - they must have drastically dropped the price on this book, because i just noticed it's now $5.99 but i know i paid way more than that for it - i believe $10-something.  just wanted to clarify, since my review said it cost ""almost as much as the paperback edition"" - it did, when i bought it.  (still don't recommend the kindle version though)",Don't Recommend Kindle Version,3,27,9,2013,1,"i didnt hate this book but i have two caveats about it  first i dont recommend the kindle version and second i dont believe its a good book for complete beginners at least the kindle version isnt

i knew how to crochet many years ago had been away from it and decided to take it up again  so i already had the very basics down and just wanted a refresher on some things that i had forgotten or never really learned correctly the first time  i think this book would have provided that information very well

however there were several major problems

first the instructional diagrams were so tiny that i could barely see them  i would guess this isnt the case in the paperback version  this is why i dont recommend it for beginners  because you really cant see the diagrams well enough for them to help and i think those diagrams are necessary for an absolute beginner

something i did this year and would now recommend anyone who's getting any of these starter ukes is to put quality strings on it asap. for example aquila nygut ($5: aq-4) or super nygut ($11: aq-100). this tiny investment will dramatically affect the tone and enjoyment of playing any of these cheaper laminate ukes. if for no other reason, do this so it will stay more in tune.

play every day to get the strings stretched as quickly as possible. and soon you'll start to notice that you're still in tune more and more often. this is the case no matter what brand of any type of stringed instrument you purchase and play.

some people have made some comments and asked some questions, so here we go:

yes : this is a ""full size"" soprano ukelele it is supposed to be this small.
no : it's not a toy, though it may look like one to some people. toy or fake or trash ukelele's are made from plastic- yes that is a thing. this uke is simply a cheap wood laminate or veneer.
yes : i like the uke for kids. and this uke being laminate is fairly sturdy. i've tossed this in the car many a time on its own (no case) and it's held up quite well. (of course let's be honest, the ""case"" it comes with this is not much more than a dust bag""

so here's what i personally loved about my firebrand in 2013. it allowed me to try the uke almost immediately and without spending an arm and a leg. is this the cheapest of the cheap? nope. wasn't then, isn't now. it's also not student or professional level either. those are way more $$$. personally, i just wanted to see if i liked it like i thought i would. and i did!

if you can spend $150 on a high end ukelele, well then... go for it! you'll have a way better instrument that you'll be happier with longer.
if you can't though... budget instruments exist for a reason.

this firebrand is still my only soprano, and i have a tenor uke as well which i play more often. i'm looking into acoustic electrics and solid wood ukes now. oh- and for anyone interested, i keep the super nygut on my firebrand, and my tenor has aquila's lava series low g (115u).",4 years and counting...,4,24,8,2016,2,"i got this kit in 2013 before it was remodeled with dvds the firebrand soprano ukulele which comes in this kit is the same as what i have from 4 years ago mine happened to shipped without the book alfreds was so good to us my husband called them and they just sent me out my book no questions asked he was and still is very impressed by them

True,2016-04-10,A15RTJWPG8OKOE,B0007Y8GSM,,"according to my order history, i bought this this kit towards the end of 2012 as a black friday week lightning deal. i'm writing this nearly four years later.

as with any stringed instrument, the strings really needed to stretch out before they would stay in tune. so, for the first several days, it was play a few minutes, tune, play a few minutes, tune. then it was tuning daily. after a few weeks of this, the uke held a tune great. a tuner is not included in the package, which is the bulk of the minus star because a real beginner wouldn't have a way to tune the thing. (you need either a tuner or a reference note, say, on a piano or keyboard.) you can download a decent tuner app, though, for a buck or so. do it, because you're going to need it a lot for the first couple of weeks.

the ""firebrand"" ukulele is a laminated instrument of unknown wood. it's kind of dead-sounding. but then, soprano ukes generally sound a bit flattish to me - it's part of their distinctive character. the finish, while smooth, is spotty, and the decal around the sound hole has bubbles. but the fretboard is just barely adequately finished, with frets that are nicely flush with the edge of the neck so the feel is smooth - and has stayed smooth despite temperature changes. the beveled fret edges are filed, but not especially polished; even so, there's nothing to snag or catch. fret dots are inset (one quite deeply) into the fingerboard and also painted on the upper edge of the neck, a nice touch. the action on mine is okay, at least down near the headstock where the starter chords live. the tuners are a triumph of cost-engineering: stamped metal with solid gears, so they're a definite step up from simple peg tuners. they make fine adjustments quite smoothly, and hold well over time. the bridge is slotted, so when you re-string you don't have to mess with that weird knot, just knot the end.

i visited a specialty ukulele shop yesterday thinking of upgrading, and played with budget beginner soprano ukes costing three times what i paid for this whole set, and to me they played about the same and most even sounded the same; a few were a bit louder. they were all, however, finished to a much higher standard. i left empty-handed, but will probably get a better uke sometime soon. they're fun!

the bag is lightly made, unpadded, and has a fixed-length strap for carrying. it offered no advantage over just grabbing the uke to carry it, while adding the considerable disadvantage of needing to unpack it to play. it promptly went into the giveaway pile.

we haven't watched the dvds, because the book has been great. it starts with c7 and f, and then adds c and g7, then g and d7. so it's not the c am f g combo very common on youtube. the songs are american folk traditionals, so if you've been around a campfire where any singing was involved, you've probably heard them before. there are lots of good instructions available online, including videos, so, really, the book is just a kick-starter to get you going. it's a pretty good book, with a reference section at the back with more chord diagrams than you're likely to need.

in all, it's an acceptable inexpensive starter set, not worth the ""list price"" but an ok value at amazon's discounted price and a bargain at the gold box/lightning deal price.

update: i changed the strings to the aquila nylgut aq-4 set. yeah, they're $10 strings on a $15 instrument, but the improvement in sound is just huge. i also polished the frets and fingerboard with a ""magic eraser""-like product (an ultra-fine abrasive), shined up the body, and filed down the plastic saddle (which simply pops out of the bridge) to lower the action. it plays and sounds much better now, although the intonation remains sharp on several notes if you go note-for-note up the frets.

update #2: ok, after going through the book i binge-watched the dvd. it consists of two segments of about 33 minutes each, each segment subdivided into easy-to-locate chapters that follow the pages of the book. it's really very good! the ""instructor"" (and remember, i bought this four years ago so this may have changed) was musician julia jordan. production values were good, and the multi-angle views of playing were helpful, as were all the play-along segments. minor quibbles: jordan played a larger ukulele than the one in the pack, so you can't hold it in the exact same way. and it seemed like the songs were keyed to a higher register than her natural speaking/singing voice (you can hear her singing her own songs on a special feature and she's very pleasant to listen to).

update #3: i now own a couple better ukuleles, have been a member of a ukulele meetup, and play a little almost every day. i can tell the difference between any of my better ukes and this one by both feel and ear. still, it's a totally useable instrument, and it got me started on an enjoyable little musical hobby. just remember to download a tuner app and maybe a metronome app and you're good to go.",A bargain-bin good-enough ukulele that's held up for years now and is still fun to play.,4,10,4,2016,2,"according to my order history i bought this this kit towards the end of 2012 as a black friday week lightning deal im writing this nearly four years later

i've been wanting to learn how to play the ukulele for a while, and, having played the piano for 6 years and recently begun lessons on the violin, i figured i'd be knowledgeable enough to pick it up fast.
i read both favorable and non-favorable reviews as to make sure my decision was well researched. i knew i wasn't getting a high-quality uke, but i wasn't planning on doing much more than learn a few songs and strum around on it, so i figured it would fit my needs just fine.
i had read that this uke doesn't hardly hold a tune at all, and that i should expect to have to tune it over and over for at least a few weeks before it held a tune for even a few hours. being prepared with this fact, i went ahead and clicked 'place order'.
as soon as the uke got here i pulled it out of the box and started attempting to tune it. the strings were very loose when it arrived (i expected this) so it was a slow process to tune it as i didn't want to break the strings by tightening them too fast. eventually i get them to the point where they loosely resembled the gcea note pattern. i spent quite awhile tuning and re-tuning them, as they would go out of tune in minutes. i had plenty of time on my hands, so i did this for probably an hour, strumming a bit and learning a chord or two, then making sure the strings were in tune. if you're a patient person (or if you're willing to stick with it), getting this uke to stay in tune won't be a big problem.
the uke itself sounds great (according to my novice ear), but since the strings aren't very high quality, i went ahead and ordered a set of aquila strings based on reviewer's suggestions. the book, contrary to many people's reviews, is helpful if you know nothing of chords (like me). it wasn't fantastic, but when combined with other chord charts and stuff i found online, it did the job.
i haven't watch the video included or listened to the cd, but i'm not expecting too much.
as it is, i think that this ukulele is perfect for someone who wants to pick up this fun little instrument for a cheap price. i've only had this for a few days so i'll update this review in a month or so to talk about it's durability and how it works with the aquila strings.","If You're Patient, You'll Get Your Money's Worth",4,13,6,2015,2,"i thought id write the very review i wouldve loved to have been able to read before i bought this objective truthful and slightly optimistic

i havent watch the video included or listened to the cd but im not expecting too much
as it is i think that this ukulele is perfect for someone who wants to pick up this fun little instrument for a cheap price ive only had this for a few days so ill update this review in a month or so to talk about its durability and how it works with the aquila strings"

True,2015-02-14,A14FJECZZIKH9A,B0007Y6NZ69,,"first of all, let dispel a few pieces of false information in some of the negative reviews.
1. this is a real uke. some have said its a toy, and i don't even know what that means. its a uke. you can play uke songs on it...but you can do that with many toy instruments as well so this concept is weird. but rest assured, there is nothing not a ukelele about this product.
2. this uke is the proper size. some reviews have been saying it isn't ""full sized"" which has led them to say its a toy. with all respect due i have to assume they did not research and don't understand how ukelele's work. this is a soprano uke. it is the smallest style of uke. still very much a uke and in fact the most popular kind both for its affordability and portability. it is small and very light, as all soprano uke's are, it is not however in any way un-standard size from any other uke. it is a normal, soprano sized uke. most people likely wanted a concert size uke. if that is what you want, buy a concert size uke. this is a soprano. there are some really good and interesting web pages that show the differences and have sound samples for the differences between a soprano, a concert, a tenor, and a baritone ukelele.
3. this uke will stay in tune. it doesn't come in tune, few insturments do unless you buy a custom from a music shop in person and they have been tuning it for you. understand something about tuning string instruments - you are essentially stretching strings and eventually those strings will stay at their correct length to give you the sound you want. at first they try to compress which constantly makes them go out of tune and later they may go the other direction. there is a happy medium place where you don't have to tune as often until you change strings and then the whole delightful process starts all over again. it gets a little better the more you use an instrument and eventually you get to the point that tuning isn't much of a chore and you can do it very quickly. right out of the box though, and this is not at all uncommon, your uke is going to be strung very loosely. you will find it goes out of tune quickly. when that happens, tune it. tune it again and again. its actually useful because you need to learn how it sounds tuned and not tuned anyhow, and you need to learn how to tune efficiently. this is part of playing music. you may decide to lightly tighten the bolts on the back if you think it comes lose very regularly. but i advise doing this once, and carefully, and only if its really every chord. even if its every minute or so, this is normal. it gets better i promise. any instrurment has to be ""trained"" to stay in tune.

so this product specifically, how is it?

at the price i got it for its perfect. 49 is too much, but 37 was good. what your getting is a perfectly normal soprano uke of budget quality. it plays, you can learn on it, there isn't anything specifically wrong with it, its just a less expensive instrument. i did see some of the little dings on the fret board edges that look like it was a part of the factory production of the instrument. please rest assured if you are new to music and just want to learn to play the uke this is not going to be a problem for you, they are very small marks. understand, and not trying to be rude but, people who have been playing music a long time tend to be very snobby about what they play on. it won't hurt your ability to play and its not even a cosmetic problem. you won't notice unless your really looking for it. chances are any uke you buy will look like that after a few weeks of wear.

do understand though that this kit, as i've said, is a soprano. soprano's are great for price and portability. some people prefer a richer sound that comes from a concert. personally i plan to graduate to a concert eventually but this suits me for learning right now. one problem people have is bigger hands can struggle with the smaller size of soprano frets. this isn't the fault of the uke its just how the insturment is. you'd have this problem with any soprano uke. i can tel lyou though i was a bass player and i played bass mostly because guitar wasn't going to work for me, and after a day or two on the uke i'm playing chords. its been a blast. i've really enjoyed this product.

its a cheap uke. i won't dispute that. but that's what most people want starting out. understand that if you make this investment you will be tuning a lot, you will have to get used to the insturment which is true of any insturment. and you likely will, eventually, want a higher quality uke. but that is pretty much true of every instrument ever. sure once i'm better at it and ready for more complex stuff, i'm likely going after a mid-range concert uke. that doesn't make this a bad product and i am very satisfied with it.

the book is cool. i've been using youtube more that the book but its very detailed and one this i will say for it is if you've been struggling to learn to read music it does a pretty decent job explaining it.

all in all this is one of the better deals for beginner uke's on amazon. this uke is ready for you, the question is just are you ready for it? getting into an instrument always requires patience and dedication. if you give it time, it will give you music. just because its for beginners and you'll likely upgrade doesn't make it a bad instrument at all.",A Great Beginner's Uke - Let's remove some misconceptions.,4,14,2,2015,2,"first of all let dispel a few pieces of false information in some of the negative reviews
