the book reads like a storybook in paragraph form.  everything is explained in great detail from choosing yarns and hooks, to how to work a large array of crochet stitches, to how to read a pattern, right down to how to care for ones crocheted items.

the stitch drawings are clear and expertly done making learning new stitches so much easier.

the book has both a contents page and an index for easy referral.  i especially liked the fact that an index was included.  so many crochet books do not include this.  the index makes it very easy to find information on a particular topic quickly.

the recommendations for people just learning to crochet are fantastic.  this book wasn't out when i learned to crochet and i learned the hard way about many of the pit falls this book helps one to avoid.  for instance they recommend one start out with a size h-8 crochet hook and a light colored worsted weight yarn.  i learned with a b-1 hook and a fingering weight yarn.  after 2 whole days of crocheting it was 36"" long and 1.5"" tall.  i was trying to make a baby blanket for my doll (which never got made).

the book contains humor, not just in the cartoons but in the instructions as well which makes for very entertaining reading while one learns a new craft.  i always appreciate having a teacher with a sense of humor!

a good sampling of designs is included so that one can try out their skills.  these include sweaters, an afghan, doilies, hot pads, pillow, scarves, floral motifs, and bandanas.

True,2013-09-27,A25NGKNSDQY9Q5,B0007Y09VO,{'Format:': ' Kindle Edition'},"i didn't hate this book, but i have two caveats about it.  first, i don't recommend the kindle version, and second, i don't believe it's a good book for complete beginners (at least the kindle version isn't).

i knew how to crochet many years ago, had been away from it, and decided to take it up again.  so i already had the very basics down and just wanted a refresher on some things that i had forgotten (or never really learned correctly the first time).  i think this book would have provided that information very well.

however, there were several major problems.

first, the instructional diagrams were so tiny that i could barely see them.  i would guess this isn't the case in the paperback version.  this is why i don't recommend it for beginners - because you really can't see the diagrams well enough for them to help, and i think those diagrams are necessary for an absolute beginner.

second, there are a number of projects in the book, but there were no pictures of the finished projects.  i have no way to decide if i want to make it or not if i can't see the finished item. apparently in the paperback version there is a ""color section"" with photos of the projects, but this was nowhere to be found in my kindle version - which is ridiculous considering how extremely well the kindle fire would be at displaying those pictures.

i chose to return this book.  i rarely, rarely return kindle books, and i debated about it for several days.  i ultimately made that decision for one main reason.  i think it's shameful when publishers cut corners with kindle editions of books, especially when the kindle edition costs *almost as much* as the paperback edition.  it's like we're being punished for choosing to read books on a kindle:  ""you're going to pay almost as much but you don't get the same content as everyone else.""  and, again, especially when there's no reason for it - the kindle fire is extremely well suited to pictures and photographs.

i'd still like a good crochet reference, and i may consider picking up this book in it's paperback form, because i still think it has good information in it.  i just want to go somewhere where i can look at it in person before i decide to do that.

but i can't recommend the kindle version, based on my experience.

edited dec. 2013 - they must have drastically dropped the price on this book, because i just noticed it's now $5.99 but i know i paid way more than that for it - i believe $10-something.  just wanted to clarify, since my review said it cost ""almost as much as the paperback edition"" - it did, when i bought it.

False,2013-01-08,A15M7QWU59WPFY,B0007Y09VO,{'Format:': ' Paperback'},"i bought this book as someone who knew the beginning crochet stitches (single, double- heck, i could even do a v-stitch), but wanted to branch out more.  i was mostly interested in learning rounds.

this book has been such an excellent help.  not only has it taught me more stitches, but i am finally getting there with the rounds i always wanted to learn to do.

i was worried at first because i'm much more of a ""hands on"" type person- learning from youtube videos or from the pages of a book has never really helped me all that much.  crocheting for dummies has wonderful step-by-step instructions and diagrams and they even teach you to read crocheting patterns by easing you in to ""crochetese"" as they call it.  for instance, in the first few patterns it tells you how it would be written in crochet language, then ""translates"" it below.  this way you can test yourself and then easily check to make sure you were reading it accurately.

i invested in some cheap, small sticky notes and can flip with ease to any stitch i want in the book as a refresher.

i highly recommend this book to take your crocheting to the next level! :)",Super Helpful!,5,8,1,2013,1,"i bought this book as someone who knew the beginning crochet stitches single double heck i could even do a vstitch but wanted to branch out more  i was mostly interested in learning rounds
