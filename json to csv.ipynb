Everything is explained in great detail from choosing yarns and hooks, to how to work a large array of crochet stitches, to how to read a pattern, right down to how to care for ones crocheted items.\\n\\nThe stitch drawings are clear and expertly done making learning new stitches so much easier.\\n\\nThe book has both a contents page and an index for easy referral.  I especially liked the fact that an index was included.  So many crochet books do not include this.  The index makes it very easy to find information on a particular topic quickly.\\n\\nThe recommendations for people just learning to crochet are fantastic.  This book wasn\\'t out when I learned to crochet and I learned the hard way about many of the pit falls this book helps one to avoid.  For instance they recommend one start out with a size H-8 crochet hook and a light colored worsted weight yarn.  I learned with a B-1 hook and a fingering weight yarn.  After 2 whole days of crocheting it was 36\" long and 1.5\" tall.  I was trying to make a baby blanket for my doll (which never got made).\\n\\nThe book contains humor, not just in the cartoons but in the instructions as well which makes for very entertaining reading while one learns a new craft.  I always appreciate having a teacher with a sense of humor!\\n\\nA good sampling of designs is included so that one can try out their skills.  These include sweaters, an afghan, doilies, hot pads, pillow, scarves, floral motifs, and bandanas.\\n\\nI am a crochet designer and I read the book cover to cover like a storybook while on vacation this past week.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and learned a few things as well.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the art of crochet.', 'summary': 'Terrific Book for Learning the Art of Crochet', 'unixReviewTime': 1092009600}\n"
